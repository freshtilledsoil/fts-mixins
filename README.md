# Sass Mixins

Collection of various Sass mixins we've used on projects.


## How to use

Pull in any individual file by referencing it with ```@import 'FILE_Name';```

Or include the full library by placing the folder in your Sass directory, and then importing the __import.scss file:

```css
  @import 'mixins/__import';
```
